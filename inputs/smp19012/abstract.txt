Measurements of production cross sections of same-sign $W^{+/-}W^{+/-}$ and 
WZ boson pairs in association with two jets in proton-proton collisions 
at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV at the LHC are reported. The data sample corresponds to an 
integrated luminosity of $137~\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ collected with 
the CMS detector during 2016--18. The measurements are performed in the leptonic decay modes 
$W^{+/-}W^{+/-} \to \ell^{+/-}\nu\ell'^{+/-}\nu$ and 
$WZ \to \ell\nu\ell'\ell'$, where $\ell, \ell' = \mathrm{e}$, 
$\mu$. Differential fiducial cross sections of the invariant masses of the jet 
and lepton pairs as well as the leading lepton transverse momentum are 
measured for the $W^{+/-}W^{+/-}$ production and found to be consistent with the 
standard model predictions. Differential fiducial cross sections of the 
invariant mass of the jet pair are also measured for the WZ production. 
An observation of electroweak production of WZ boson pairs is reported, 
with an observed (expected) significance of 6.8 (5.3) standard deviations. 
Constraints are obtained on the structure of quartic vector boson interactions 
in the framework of effective theory.
