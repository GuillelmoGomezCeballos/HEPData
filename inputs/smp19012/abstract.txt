Measurements of production cross sections of WZ and same-sign $W^\pm W^\pm$ boson pairs in association with two jets in proton-proton collisions 
at $\sqrt{s}$=13TeV at the LHC are reported. The data sample corresponds to an 
integrated luminosity of 137$fb^{-1}$, collected with 
the CMS detector during 2016--2018. The measurements are performed in the leptonic decay modes 
$W^\pm Z \to \ell^\pm\nu\ell'^\pm\ell'^\mp$ and 
$W^\pm W^\pm \to \ell^\pm\nu\ell'^\pm\nu$, where $\ell, \ell' = e$, 
$\mu$. Differential fiducial cross sections as functions of the invariant masses of the jet 
and charged lepton pairs, as well as of the leading-lepton transverse momentum, are 
measured for WW production and are consistent with the 
standard model predictions. The dependence of differential cross sections 
on the invariant mass of the jet pair is also measured for WZ production. 
An observation of electroweak production of WZ boson pairs is reported 
with an observed (expected) significance of 6.8 (5.3) standard deviations. 
Constraints are obtained on the structure of quartic vector boson interactions 
in the framework of effective field theory.
