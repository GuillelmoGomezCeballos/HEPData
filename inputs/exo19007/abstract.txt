A search is presented for decays of a Higgs boson to an invisible particle 
together with an isolated photon, using the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron 
Collider. The Higgs boson is produced in association with a Z boson. The 
analysis is performed using a dataset recorded in 2016-18 corresponding to an 
integrated luminosity of 137 fb-1, at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No 
significant excess of events above the standard model expectation is found, and 
the results are interpreted to place limits on the cross section times 
branching fraction of such decays of the Higgs boson.
