Measurements are presented of the differential cross sections for Z bosons 
produced in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV and decaying to 
muons and electrons. The data analyzed were collected in 2016 with the CMS 
detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.8 fb-1. 
The measured fiducial inclusive product of cross section and branching 
fraction agrees with next-to-next-to-leading order quantum chromodynamics 
calculations. Differential cross sections of the transverse momentum pt, the 
optimized angular variable $\phi^{\scriptscriptstyle *}_\eta$, and the rapidity 
of lepton pairs are measured. The data are corrected for detector effects and 
compared to theoretical predictions using fixed order, resummed, and parton 
shower calculations. The uncertainties of the measured normalized cross 
sections are smaller than 0.5% for $\phi^{\scriptscriptstyle *}_\eta$ $<$ 0.5 
and for pt $<$ 50 GeV.
