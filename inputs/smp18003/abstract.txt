Measurements of inclusive and differential fiducial Z boson production cross 
sections in pp collisions at center of mass energy of 13 TeV are presented. 
The data sample was collected with the CMS detector in 2016 and corresponds to 
an integrated luminosity of  35.9 fb-1. In these measurements, the Z boson is 
identified via its decays to a pair of neutrinos, in association with jets. The 
cross section is measured as a function of the Z boson transverse momentum, and 
the results are also combined with already published measurements from charged 
lepton decays of the Z boson.
