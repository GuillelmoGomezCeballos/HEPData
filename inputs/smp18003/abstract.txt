Measurements of the total and differential fiducial cross sections for the 
Z boson decaying into two neutrinos are presented at the LHC in proton-proton 
collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data were collected by 
the CMS detector in 2016 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. 
In these measurements, events are selected containing an imbalance in transverse 
momentum and one or more energetic jets. The fiducial differential cross section 
is measured as a function of the Z boson transverse momentum. The results are 
combined with a previous measurement of charged-lepton decays of the Z boson.
